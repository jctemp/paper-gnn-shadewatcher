abstract = {In this article, we provide a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs, which have recently garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in scenarios that require exploiting diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of data. After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.},

abstract = {The document-centric workflows in science have reached (or already exceeded) the limits of adequacy. This is emphasized by recent discussions on the increasing proliferation of scientific literature and the reproducibility crisis. This presents an opportunity to rethink the dominant paradigm of document-centric scholarly information communication and transform it into knowledge-based information flows by representing and expressing information through semantically rich, interlinked knowledge graphs. At the core of knowledge-based information flows is the creation and evolution of information models that establish a common understanding of information communicated between stakeholders as well as the integration of these technologies into the infrastructure and processes of search and information exchange in the research library of the future. By integrating these models into existing and new research infrastructure services, the information structures that are currently still implicit and deeply hidden in documents can be made explicit and directly usable. This has the potential to revolutionize scientific work as information and research results can be seamlessly interlinked with each other and better matched to complex information needs. Furthermore, research results become directly comparable and easier to reuse. As our main contribution, we propose the vision of a knowledge graph for science, present a possible infrastructure for such a knowledge graph as well as our early attempts towards an implementation of the infrastructure.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are being widely applied in many application settings to suggest products, services, and information items to potential consumers. Collaborative filtering, the most successful recommendation approach, makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests. A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback. Such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore. We experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained Leaky Capacitor algorithm, a branch-and-bound serial symbolic search algorithm, and a Hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm. These algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach, two variations of the user-based approach, and an item-based approach. Our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision, recall, the F-measure, and the rank score. We also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach, that is, incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may "dilute" the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance.},

abstract = {While collaborative filtering is the dominant technique in personalized recommendation, it models user-item interactions only and cannot provide concrete reasons for a recommendation. Meanwhile, the rich side information affiliated with user-item interactions (e.g., user demographics and item attributes), which provide valuable evidence that why a recommendation is suitable for a user, has not been fully explored in providing explanations. On the technical side, embedding-based methods, such as Wide\&Deep and neural factorization machines, provide state-of-the-art recommendation performance. However, they work like a black-box, for which the reasons underlying a prediction cannot be explicitly presented. On the other hand, tree-based methods like decision trees predict by inferring decision rules from data. While being explainable, they cannot generalize to unseen feature interactions thus fail in collaborative filtering applications. In this work, we propose a novel solution named Tree-enhanced Embedding Method that combines the strengths of embedding-based and tree-based models. We first employ a tree-based model to learn explicit decision rules (aka. cross features) from the rich side information. We next design an embedding model that can incorporate explicit cross features and generalize to unseen cross features on user ID and item ID. At the core of our embedding method is an easy-to-interpret attention network, making the recommendation process fully transparent and explainable. We conduct experiments on two datasets of tourist attraction and restaurant recommendation, demonstrating the superior performance and explainability of our solution.},

abstract = {In a provenance-aware system, mechanisms gather and report metadata that describes the history of each object being processed on the system, allowing users to understand how data objects came to exist in their present state. However, while past work has demonstrated the usefulness of provenance, less attention has been given to securing provenance-aware systems. Provenance itself is a ripe attack vector, and its authenticity and integrity must be guaranteed before it can be put to use.We present Linux Provenance Modules (LPM), the first general framework for the development of provenance-aware systems. We demonstrate that LPM creates a trusted provenance-aware execution environment, collecting complete whole-system provenance while imposing as little as 2.7% performance overhead on normal system operation. LPM introduces new mechanisms for secure provenance layering and authenticated communication between provenance-aware hosts, and also interoperates with existing mechanisms to provide strong security assurances. To demonstrate the potential uses of LPM, we design a Provenance-Based Data Loss Prevention (PB-DLP) system. We implement PBDLP as a file transfer application that blocks the transmission of files derived from sensitive ancestors while imposing just tens of milliseconds overhead. LPM is the first step towards widespread deployment of trustworthy provenance-aware applications.},

abstract = {SPADE is an open source software infrastructure for data provenance collection and management. The underlying data model used throughout the system is graph-based, consisting of vertices and directed edges that are modeled after the node and relationship types described in the Open Provenance Model. The system has been designed to decouple the collection, storage, and querying of provenance metadata. At its core is a novel provenance kernel that mediates between the producers and consumers of provenance information, and handles the persistent storage of records. It operates as a service, peering with remote instances to enable distributed provenance queries. The provenance kernel on each host handles the buffering, filtering, and multiplexing of incoming metadata from multiple sources, including the operating system, applications, and manual curation. Provenance elements can be located locally with queries that use wildcard, fuzzy, proximity, range, and Boolean operators. Ancestor and descendant queries are transparently propagated across hosts until a terminating expression is satisfied, while distributed path queries are accelerated with provenance sketches.},

We describe a PASS implementation, discussing the challenges it presents, performance cost it incurs, and the new functionality it enables. We show that with reasonable overhead, we can provide useful functionality not available in today's file systems or provenance management systems.},
