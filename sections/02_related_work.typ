- use whole-system provenance
- have real-time graph-based anomaly detection
- monitors long-term system behaviour (changes over time => concept drift)
- mitigate allowing model to forget (weight decay)
- build graph histogram based on features (_HistoSketch_)
- compares graphs => anomaly detection
