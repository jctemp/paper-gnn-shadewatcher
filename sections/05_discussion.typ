- What are the benefits?
- How useful is the concept?
- How well does recommendation fit threat detection?

TranR is an inductive approach @inductive-link-prediction-2022, might be useful to consider inductive learning. Besides retraining for unseen data is potentially expensive @inductive-link-prediction-2017, for that consider larger numbers for dimensions and its effect on runtime @link-prediction-article-2017.

Data contamination -> hypothesise robust (further investigation for real world scenarios).
\
Attacker can perform adversarial attack on GNN by manipulating KG. To what extent is that possible?
